# How to write readable code
the lectures today were based on some of my articles. Here they are:

Be sure to use those links specifically! Otherwise you might get paywalled.

Also, someone asked for a formatting guide, here's a good one.

But remember, you can find all sorts of oppinions/facts on style guides by googling "JS Style Guides." Also, to clarify, you might hear people say "do not use tabs" that's not the same as "Do not use the tab _key_". A literal tab character ("\t") can be interpreted differently by different programs. However, *most* editors are configured that the tab key actually just types out 2 or 4 spaces. Please do not literally use the space bar.
